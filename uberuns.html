					What started out as a small interior design blog focusing on the documentation of Amberâ€™s experience as a first-time homeowner and her passions for all things interiors, has since turned into a successful design and build firm with clients all over the country, a line of furniture and homegoods, an e-commerce business, a brick and mortar retail operation, and a social media following with an audience reach in the millions.

					Amber Lewis grew up by the beach in Malibu California. Being raised by an effortlessly hippy-chic mom and a construction developer father, also both California natives, her parents constantly encouraged their three kids to explore their creative sides and to adventure often. Amber always found herself more interested

					in art classes then history lessons, and knew early on as long as she was being creative in some form or another she was happy. Growing up in such a beautiful place had its perks, however, after high school she knew she wanted to venture out into the world and figure out how she could turn that passion for â€œcreatingâ€ into a life long career. A brief stint in fashion school, and a few semesters in the UCLA interior design program, Amber ultimately landed an amazing job as an assistant at an interior design firm where she spent a couple years absorbing the ins and outs of the interior design business. Eventually she used her experience to branch out all on her own, and the rest is history.

					As principal at Amber Interior Design and founder of the blog, Amber Interiors, she has garnered clients and followers from around the world. Amber imbues a bit of bohemian elegance in all of her projects, but craves a design challenge and opportunities to show off her ever-evolving style. No matter what the style she is asked to create, each space designed by Amber feels cozy, eclectic, and unique.

					Today Amber Interior Design, Inc. provides designs for everything from large scale residences to extensive commercial projects. Amber and her team work with architects and contractors to bring the distinct visions seen in her work, on her blog and in her retail Shoppe, to life. Light filled rooms, colorful textiles, natural elements, earthy textures, and brushed metals, are the elements that define and can always distinguish an Amber Interiors designed home.

					Amber currently lives in Calabasas with her husband and business partner Mike, their daughter Gwyneth, and fur babies Penny, Billie, Stella, and Stevie (all rescue animals).
